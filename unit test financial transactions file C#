For this assignment you will be working with a file of credit (essentially deposit) and debit (essentially withdrawal) transactions. The file will have several classes of detectable errors in it. Your task is to sort the transactions into three classes:
 A file of credit transactions
 A file of debit transactions
 A file of transactions with detected errors

Field :Client Number
Format: 9-digit number; may have leading zeroes
Value restrictions: Final digit must be a valid check digit*
Field :Transaction Type
Format: 2-characters
Value restrictions: ‘Cr’ for a Credit transaction or ‘Dr’ for a Debit transaction
Field: Transaction Date
Format: dd/mm/yyyy
Value restrictions: Transaction date must be in 2011 or 2012
Field: Transaction Amount
Value restrictions: 1-4 digits, a decimal place, and two digits
Value restrictions: Must be >0 and <5000


You will produce three output files: CreditFile.txt, DebitFile.txt and ErrorFile.txt. 
Any transaction with a detectable error must be written to ErrorFile.txt. 
All ‘clean’ transactions go to CreditFile.txt or DebitFile.txt depending on their transaction type code. 
The format of the transaction records should be exactly as it was on input (e.g. comma delimited) – write transactions
with errors to ErrorFile.txt exactly as they appeared in Transactions.txt.
